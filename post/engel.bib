 abstract = {The purpose of our study is to investigate how Ernst Engel acquired the data of Table 8, in his original article of 1857, where he gave quantitative material to support his qualitatively stated law elsewhere. In the introduction (section 1) some comments are given on reviews on Engel's article, whereas in section 2 the problem will be outlined. There is a problem because the data of Engel's Table 8, when plotted on a double-log graph paper, form a straight line. In section 3 some possible methods used by Engel will be investigated, with successively increasing plausibility. We were able to obtain strong evidence that Engel used very simple arithmetics to set up his range, which is, by genuine intuition, a very good approximation of his rough material (the 235 budget data collected by Ducpetiaux and Le Play). /// Le but de notre étude est de rechercher comment Ernst Engel obtint les données de la table 8, dans son article original de 1857, où il fournit les éléments quantitatifs à l'appui de sa loi établie qualitativement par ailleurs. Dans l'introduction (section 1) quelques commentaiers sont donnés sur les publications dont a fait l'objet l'article d'Engel, tandis que dans la section 2 le problème lui-même est traité. Il y a problème parce que les données de la table 8 d'Engel, lorsqu' on les porte sur un graphique à échelle double-log s'alignent sur une droite. Dans la section 3, quelques unes des méthodes qu'a pu utiliser Engel sont examinées, suivant un ordre de plausabilité croissante. On est en mesure de mettre fortement en évidence que Engel utilise une arithmétique très simple pour établir cet alignement qui constitue, grâce à une pure intuition, une très bonne approximation des données brutes (235 résultats de budgets rassemblés par Ducpetiaux et Le Play).},

abstract="Engel's Law states that the share of food in total expenditures is inversely related to the household's income (or some other measure of its total resources). This implies that the income elasticity of food expenditure is less than one. Of all empirical regularities observed in economic data, Engel's Law is probably the best established; indeed it holds not only in the cross-section data where it was first observed, but has often been confirmed in time-series analysis as well. Like most economic laws, however, it holds ceteris paribus prices, among other things, are assumed constant. There is also evidence that the income elasticity of food, like the budget share, is inversely related to income; the elasticity may be as high as 0.8 or 0.9 at very low income levels, and close to zero for high incomes. As Engel himself emphasized, his law has profound consequences for economic development. Food is the main product of agriculture; therefore a declining share of food in aggregate consumption implies a declining share of agriculture in aggregate production. `Balanced growth', in which all sectors grow at the same rate, is impossible. A full analysis of the effects of Engel's Law would require explicit consideration of relative prices and of productivity in the farm and nonfarm sectors; foreign trade may also have an effect. Under plausible assumptions the number of farmers and farm workers will decline not only relatively but also absolutely, and population will flow from rural to urban areas. If these adjustments do not occur quickly enough, per capita income in the farm sector will fall behind its nonfarm equivalent. In developed countries this phenomenon is known as the `farm problem'. It can be shown (Houthakker 1967) that the severity of this problem depends on the growth rate of farm productivity: by becoming more efficient farmers tend to work themselves (or more precisely their less efficient competitors) out of a job. The root cause, however, is Engel's Law, which is peculiar to food; attempts to demonstrate similar laws for other categories of expenditure have had less success. It should be added that when applying to agricultural development the decomposition of the expenditure elasticity into a quantity and a quality elasticity is relevant. The reason is that, by and large, agriculture produces quantity, while food processing and trade produce quality. In the case of total food Bunkers and Cochrane (1957) have shown that the quantity elasticity is much less than the expenditure elasticity.",

    abstract = { This paper proposes a regression model where the response is beta distributed using a parameterization of the beta law that is indexed by mean and dispersion parameters. The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed. }

 abstract = {The problem of specifying and estimating the variance of estimated parameters based on complex sample designs from finite populations is considered. The results of this paper are particularly useful when the parameter estimators cannot be defined explicitly as a function of other statistics from the sample. It is shown how these results can be applied to linear regression, logistic regression and log linear contingency table models. An example of the application of the technique to the Canada Health Survey is given. /// On discute le problème de la spécification et de l'estimation de la variance de paramètres estimés basés sur les plans d'échantillonnage complexes provenant de populations finies.
