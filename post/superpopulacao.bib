abstract = {Abstract In sampling from a finite population, we often find it reasonable to posit a probability model (“superpopulation model”) that characterizes relations among variables that pertain to the units of the population. Such a model enables us to make inferences about population characteristics based on sample measurements and “auxiliary information”. In effect, we use the model to predict values for those units of the population that have not been sampled. In such prediction-based (or model-based) sampling and inference, it is important to guard against problems arising from model failure. Selecting a balanced sample or weighted balanced sample provides bias protection in the important case of estimating means or totals. Robust variance estimators guard against misapprehension of the variance structure.}

The results of this paper are particularly useful when the parameter estimators cannot be defined explicitly as a function of other statistics from the sample. It is shown how these results can be applied to linear regression, logistic regression and log linear contingency table models.

abstract = "This chapter discusses the issues associated with making inferences about model parameters from survey data that have been obtained from a probability–sampling scheme using a frequency-based framework. In sample surveys, information is collected from a sample of units from a finite population. It is common for the sampling plan to be complex, which is defined as any sampling plan where the units are selected using a design that is not simple random sampling. When a survey is conducted, the survey producer targets a particular population of inference or a particular set of populations of inference. It is important to distinguish between two types of populations: the survey population and the target populations. It is presumed that the realizations of the random variables generated by such a model have given rise to the values of the characteristics of interest in the finite population from which the sample was selected. The relationship between the units of a population and the units of analysis is important. The researcher must be aware of the differences between the two types of units."

Familiar examples include the estimation of income elasticities from household surveys, the analysis of labor market dynamics from labor force surveys, and the study of the relationships between risk factors and disease incidence from health surveys. The data are usually collected for samples drawn by probability sampling. This induces a set of base weights for the sampled units reflecting unequal selection probabilities. When the sampling weights are related to the values of the model outcome variable even after conditioning on the model covariates, the observed outcomes are no longer representative of the population outcomes due to the sampling or response process and the model holding for the sample data is then different from the model holding in the population. The sample distribution refers to the distribution of the sample measurements, as defined by the population model and the sampling design, with the realized sample of respondents held fixed."

abstract = "Many surveys are repeated on several occasions, and the associated estimates are used to analyze changes in variables over time. Major social and economic surveys, such as labor force and retail trade surveys (RTS), are conducted monthly or quarterly to identify changes in the level or rate of change of variables, including turning points. Many repeated surveys involve overlap in the sample between different time periods. The sample overlap induces a correlation structure in the sampling errors of the time series of estimates, which affects the analysis of changes in them and may be exploited in producing estimates. In a panel or longitudinal survey, an initial sample is selected and at each occasion that the survey is conducted an attempt is made to include all the members of the initial sample, even if they move. Longitudinal surveys are developed to permit analysis of changes at the individual level. In a repeated survey, there is not necessarily any overlap of the sample for the different occasions. When the emphasis is on estimates for the population and major subpopulations, an independent sample may be used on each occasion, which is often the case when the interval between the surveys is large."

It describes national income accounts, index number, and other problems that underlie international comparisons of income levels and growth rates. Tools for microeconomic analysis are discussed in the chapter, with emphasis on the use of survey data through a range of more or less familiar econometric topics, methods for strengthening the robustness of inference, and common pitfalls and difficulties. Time-series techniques and their uses in the analysis of development questions are discussed in the chapter. Nonparametric techniques for estimating density functions, regression functions, and the derivatives of regression functions are also discussed. Non-parametric analysis requires a great deal of data, there are a number of questions in the development economics susceptible to non-parametric treatment using survey data." }
