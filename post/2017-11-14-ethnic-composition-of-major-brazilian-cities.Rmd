Some time ago, I came across this [nice post](https://www.blog.cultureofinsight.com/2017/06/building-dot-density-maps-with-uk-census-data-in-r/) showing how ethnicity is distributed in London. This is very interesting, as it reveals patterns about how communities are organized and how inequality express itself upon housing locations. 

Our task today is to apply the same procedure to large Brazilian cities. Here's our list of municipalities: [São Paulo](#SP), [Rio de Janeiro](#RJ), [Brasília](#BSB), [Recife](#REC), [Salvador](#SAL), and ~~home~~ [Manaus](#MAO).


## São Paulo {#SP}

## Rio de Janeiro {#RJ}

## Brasília {#BSB}

## Recife {#REC}

In order to produce a nicer map, I added to the map other two municipalities of Recife's metropolitan area: Jaboatão dos Guararapes and Olinda.

## Salvador {#SAL}

## Manaus {#MAO}

Since Manaus' population is largely concentrated in the urban area, I decided to plot only those census tracts.
