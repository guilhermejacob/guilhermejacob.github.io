abstract="The generalized beta (GB) is considered as a model for the distribution of income. It is well known that its special cases include Dagum's distribution along with the Singh-Maddala distribution. Related measures of inequality such as the Gini Coefficient, Pietra Index, or Theil Index are expressed in terms of the parameters of the generalized beta. This paper also explores the use of numerical integration techniques for calculating inequality indexes. Numerical integration may be useful since in some cases it may be computationally very difficult to evaluate the equations that have been derived or the equations are not available. We provide examples from the distribution of family income in the United States for the year 2000.",

  abstract={Do survey respondents misreport their income? If so, how does misreporting correlate with income, how does this affect estimates of income inequality, and how well do existing methods correct for bias? We use a novel database in which a subsample of Uruguayâ€™s official household survey has been linked to tax records to document the extent and distribution of labor income underreporting and to assess the performance of various existing methods to correct inequality estimates. Individuals in the upper half of the income distribution tend to report less labor income in household surveys than those same individuals earn according to tax returns, and underreporting is increasing in income. Using simulations, we find that this leads to downwardbiased inequality estimates. Correction methods that rely only on survey data barely affect the biased inequality estimates, while methods that combine survey and tax data can lead to overcorrection and overestimation of inequality.},

abstract = {We estimate the extent of income underreporting among working households, using data from an income survey linked with individual tax records for Estonia. Income underreporting is inferred from consumption propensities, following and extending the method by Pissarides andWeber (1989). Our dataset allows us to assess the validity of the key assumption in related studies that survey income corresponds to income reported to the tax authority. Our results show large underreporting of earnings by the self-employed and also substantial underreporting of earnings by private sector employees on the basis of register income, while a much smaller scale of non-compliance is detected for self-employed and no underreporting for private employees using survey incomes. This suggests that previous studies applying this methodology to survey data have underestimated the extent of non-compliance.},

 abstract = {A large literature shows that the self-employed underreport their income to tax authorities. In this paper, we quantify the extent to which the self-employed also systematically underreport their income in U.S. household surveys. We use the Engel curve describing the relationship between income and expenditures of wage and salary workers to infer the actual income, and thus the reporting gap, of the self-employed based on their reported expenditures. On average, the self-employed underreport their income by about 25%. We show that failing to account for such income underreporting leads to biased conclusions in a variety of settings.},

  abstract={It is generally accepted that household surveys fail to accurately portray the top tail of the income distribution. Indeed, studies based on tax data challenge the credibility of surveys as a source to study inequality. To date, there is no broad consensus on how to best reconcile these two datasets. This paper presents a novel method that enables a consistent combination of these two sources of data, under the assumption that tax data sets a credible lower bound on the amount of people with given levels of income. The resulting micro-dataset preserves the consistency of other socio-demographic variables at both the individual and aggregate levels. It thus allows researchers to analyze dimensions of social inequality under a more representative distributive framework. Our procedure is illustrated by empirical applications to five countries, covering both developed and less-developed contexts over numerous years.},
