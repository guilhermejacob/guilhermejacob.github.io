  abstract = {For a finite universe of N items, it is proved no one can lie more than sqrt(N-1) standard deviations away from the mean. This is an improvement over the result given by Tchebycheff's inequality: and a similar improvement is possible when speaking of how far from the mean any odd-number r out of N observations can lie. However, the relative inefficiency of Tchebycheff's inequality as applied to a finite universe does go to zero as N goes to infinity.},

We also show that the adding-up constraint on the deviations from sample means implicit in Trenkler and Puntanen's [14] multivariate generalisation of Samuelson's Inequality can be regarded as a special case of a more general formulation involving a set of linear constraints on the deviations.},

  abstract  = {We examine an 1880 theorem of Laguerre [50] concerning polynomials with all real roots and a 1968 inequality of Sanmelson [117] for the maximum and minimum deviation from the mean, and establish their equivalence. The bounds provided by Laguerre's Theorem involve the first three coefficients of an n-th degree polynomial while Samuelson's Inequality is in terms of the standard deviation (and the mean) of a set of n real numbers (observations). We present eight proofs of this Laguerre-Samuelson inequality and survey the literature; we also give various extensions and applications in statistics and matrix theory. We include some historical and biographical information and present an extensive bibliography with over 100 entries.},
