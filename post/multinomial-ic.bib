The results are obtained by examining the “worst” possible value of a multinomial parameter vector, analogous to the case in which a binomial parameter equals one-half.},

  abstract = {A method is described for determining the sample size required for a specified precision simultaneous confidence statement about the parameters of a multinomial population. The method is based on a simultaneous confidence interval procedure due to Goodman, and the results are compared with those obtained by separately considering each cell of the multinomial population as a binomial.},
