  abstract={Innovations in statistical methodology is often accompanied by Monte-Carlo studies. In the context of survey statistics two types of inferences have to be considered. First, the classical randomization methods used for developments in statistical modelling. Second, survey data is typically gathered using random sampling schemes from a finite population. In this case, the sampling inference under a finite population model drives statistical conclusions. For empirical analyses, in general, mainly survey data is available. So the question arises how best to conduct the simulation study accompanying the empirical research. In addition, economists and social scientists often use statistical models on the survey data where the statistical inference is based on the classical randomization approach based on the model assumptions. This confounds classical randomization with sampling inference. The question arises under which circumstances – if any – the sampling design can then be ignored. In both fields of research – official statistics and (micro-)econometrics – Monte-Carlo studies generally seek to deliver additional information on an estimator’s distribution. The two named inferences obviously impact distributional assumptions and, hence, must be distinguished in the Monte-Carlo set-up. Both, the conclusions to be drawn and comparability between research results, therefore, depend on inferential assumptions and the consequently adapted simulation study. The present paper gives an overview of the different types of inferences and combinations thereof that are possibly applicable on survey data. Additionally, further types of Monte-Carlo methods are elaborated to provide answers in mixed types of randomization in the survey context as well as under statistical modelling using survey data. The aim is to provide a common understanding of Monte-Carlo based studies using survey data including a thorough discussion of advantages and disadvantages of the different types and thei},

abstract = {Simulation studies are computer experiments that involve creating data by pseudo-random sampling. A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some “truth” (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“ADEMP”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

We outline how DAE methods can be used to plan and analyze simulation studies. Tools for planning include cause-and-effect diagrams and factorial and fractional factorial designs. Analysis is carried out via analysis of variance, main effect and interaction plots, and other DAE tools. We also demonstrate how Taguchi robust parameter design can be used to study the robustness of methods to a variety of uncontrollable population parameters.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a general technique for the treatment of samples drawn without replacement from finite universes when unequal selection probabilities are used. Two sampling schemes are discussed in connection with the problem of determining optimum selection probabilities according to the information available in a supplementary variable. Admittedly, these two schemes have limited application. They should prove useful, however, for the first stage of sampling with multi-stage designs, since both permit unbiased estimation of the sampling variance without resorting to additional assumptions.},

abstract = {In [3] the author established necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic normality of estimates based on simple random sampling without replacement from a finite population, and thus solved a comparatively old problem initiated by W. G. Madow [8]. The solution was obtained by approximating simple random sampling by so called Poisson sampling, which may be decomposed into independent subexperiments, each associated with a single unit in the population. In the present paper the same method is used for deriving asymptotic normality conditions for a special kind of sampling with varying probabilities called here rejective sampling. Rejective sampling may be realized by $n$ independent draws of one unit with fixed probabilities, generally varying from unit to unit, given the condition that samples in which all units are not distinct are rejected. If the drawing probabilities are constant, rejective sampling coincides, with simple random sampling without replacement, and so the present paper is a generalization of [3]. Basic facts about rejective sampling are exposed in Section 2. To obtain more refined results, Poisson sampling is introduced and analyzed (Section 3) and then related to rejective sampling (Section 4). Next three sections deal with probabilities of inclusion, variance formulas and asymptotic normality of estimators for rejective sampling. In Section 8 asymptotic formulas are tested numerically and applications to sample surveys are indicated. The paper is concluded by short-cuts in practical performance of rejective sampling. The readers interested in applications only may concentrate upon Sections 1, 8 and 9. Those interested in the theory of mean values and variances only, may omit Lemma 4.3 and Section 7.},

This paper demonstrates that the sampling distribution departs from normality as the sample size approaches the finite population size. }

abstract = { Proof of the central limit theorem for the sample mean can be obtained in the case of independent and identically distributed randomvariables through the moment generating function under some simplifying assumptions. The case for the central limit theorem for the sample mean from finite populations under simple random sample without replacement, the parallel to the simplest case in the standard framework, is not as simple. Most sampling textbooks avoid any technical discussion of the finite population central limit theorem so that there is little appreciation for the conditions that underlay the theorem. Most often the theorem is illustrated with a simulation study; but this can only hint at the technicalities of the theorem. Now, new software has been developed that allows for automatic calculation of moments and cumulants of estimators used in survey sampling, as well as automatic derivation of unbiased or consistent estimators. This software is used to examine the assumptions behind the applications of central limit theorem under simple random sampling without replacement. Moreover, the demonstration of the theorem through this software relies on the cumulant generating function thus providing a parallel to the demonstration of the theorem in the standard case. }
